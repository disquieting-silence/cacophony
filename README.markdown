cacophony
=========

`cacophony` is mostly just an experiment. For someone to find it useful, they have to:

* like the `vi` style of keyboard-driven development
* still think MIDIs have some purpose
* use the `javax` MIDI libraries
* want to create their own MIDIs

You don't need a venn diagram to realise that this isn't exactly a large market. I think it would aspire to be niche. That said, `cacophony` exists. Another thing it has in common with `vi` is that is not intuitive how to quit.


Installation
------------

`cacophony` does not need to be installed. Simply run `ant` from the source directory and it should compile and start. Of course, it won't work.

Commands
